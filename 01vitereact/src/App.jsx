      <h1>Chai aur Code | Rohan Kumar Jha</h1>
      <p>React js is a library of js and it has a lot of advantages like single page apllication , code resuability , manages dom, <etc styleName=""></etc></p>

      <p>NPM(node package manager) : just like playstore that proides android applications , its provide packages which used to build websites</p>

      <p>Utility : eg:vite/parcel/create react app  : packages that provide some useful functionality or tools that can be used in development or as part of a larger application</p>

      <p>doing some manipulation in files (mostly deleting)</p>

      <p>CRA(Utility): bulky and provides a  lot of packages that is not neccessary , thats why we use vite/parcel</p>

      <p>all dependecies that are written in package.json are getting downloaded in node modules</p>

      <p>some useless things:: manifest: used for managing phone functionality and robost for seo </p>

      <Chai />
